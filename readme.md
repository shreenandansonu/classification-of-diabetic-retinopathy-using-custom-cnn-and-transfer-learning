# **CLASSIFICATION of Diabetic Retinopathy using CUSTOM CNN and TRANSFER LEARNING**

![image.png](./results/thumbnail.png)

Developed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify retinal fundus images into severity levels of diabetic retinopathy.

Preprocessed and augmented dataset (rotation, scaling, flipping) to improve generalization.

Split dataset into training, validation, and testing sets for performance evaluation.

Achieved 71% accuracy on the test set, with confusion matrix analysis to identify class-wise performance.

Tools: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
